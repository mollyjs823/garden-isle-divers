          <h5>Introduction to Scuba</h5>
          <p>
            This class is very popular with island visitors and locals alike.
            It’s perfect for people who have always been curious about scuba,
            but haven’t had the time or motivation to enroll in the full
            certification course. We offer a safe and enjoyable learning
            experience that will get you and your companions diving Kaua'i’s
            best reefs in a matter of hours. This is truly one of those
            experiences that can change the way a person views the world and
            inspire a newfound love for our oceans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our PADI instruction begins on land where we will discuss safety,
            introduce the new divers to their gear, and practice necessary dive
            skills in a controlled environment. After that it’s into the ocean
            where you will discover why scuba is one of the fastest-growing
            sports in the nation! From start to finish this activity usually
            runs about 4 hours for instruction and 2 scuba dives. Its amazing to
            think that a person can go from only dreaming about the experience
            to having some instruction and 2 open-water dives under their belt
            all before lunch! Now that’s a vacation to remember!

          <h5>Open Water Scuba Diver</h5>
          <p>
            Let's go diving! Begin the journey today and start working towards
            your PADI Open Water Scuba Diver rating. This class offers you the
            flexibility to study online via the PADI e-learner program, or with
            a traditional textbook and guidance from you instructor. Once the
            bookwork/knowledge development portion is completed, you spend time
            familiarizing yourself with the gear and the art of scuba in a
            controlled water environment. The last and most exciting part of the
            class will be the 4 dives you complete in the ocean under the
            guidance of your PADI dive instructor. You have the dream to dive,
            let us help get you there.

          <h5>Rescue Diver</h5>
          <p>
            A well trained diver is thinking about the safety of others and
            his/her ability to help when needed. Become a rescue diver and learn
            to handle practically any issue that may arise during a dive
            excursion. You will be practicing such skills as surfacing with an
            unconscious diver, first aid and CPR, lost diver procedure, and
            panicked diver rescue, just to name a few. If there is one class
            that people say they grow the most from, it would be the rescue
            class. Contact us by phone or email to discuss options available.
